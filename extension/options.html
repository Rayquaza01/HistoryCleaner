            <p>Setting the number of days will delete anything older than that amount of days. (Setting it to 7 will delete any history older than a week)</p>
            <p>Setting a number of visits will cause it to delete sites only with that amount of visits or less. (Setting it to 5 will delete any URLs from your history that you only visited 5 or less times.)</p>
            <p>If you have both a number of days and a number of visits set, it will delete history older than the number of days AND less than the number of visits. (Setting them to 7 and 5 will cause it to delete any is both older than a week AND has been visited 5 or less times.)</p>
